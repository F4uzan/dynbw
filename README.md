DynBW, a dynamic kernel builder wrapper
------
DynBW is a customizable, universal Linux kernel builder. It is highly flexible, allowing further customizations when users needs it, it also not tied to kernel versions and architecture.

Currently in alpha testing, it lacks any advanced features but I'm working to improve it.
