DynBW, a dynamic kernel build wrapper
------
DynBW is an easy-to-use kernel buildscript for Android-compatible kernel source. It is highly flexible and practical - all without a fancy semi-graphical interface. Its goal is to simplify and automate the process of building kernels, leaning towards newcomers to the kernel-building scenario.

Compatible with practically everything that uses POSIX SH. This guarantees a vast and wide compatibility with most Linux distributions and even those that are not inherently Linux but can use POSIX SH, such as macOS.

This README is for the newest DynBW version. Those looking for older and deprecated version of DynBW can check the "deprecated" folder. Do note that the deprecated version will not be updated and is susceptible to issues.
