# DynBW Help File
#
# This is a quick help that'll guide you to the basics of DynBW

# 1.) Before Using
- Make sure you have a proper kernel source
- Also, don't forget a cross compiler inteded for your phone's architecture
- And make sure your computer runs on Linux with 64 bit OS/kernel and 64 bit CPU

# 2.) How to Use
- Launch install.sh in a Terminal Emulator window
	Use: ./install.sh
- The installation will prompt you to paste a full path to a folder
	Example: /home/user/Kernel/my_awesome_kernel
- Once the installation is done, go to the folder path and open a Terminal Emulator window
- Launch dynbw.sh
	Use: ./dynbw.sh
- DynBW will set up the common configurations
	Architecture is your phone CPU architecture (arm, armv8, x86, x86_64)
	Cross Compile path should follow this format : /home/user/folder-to-toolchain (DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ELSE)
	Defconfig is the default defconfig you would use (this loads device-specific configuration for your kernel)
- There will be some advanced settings, some of them are pretty self explanatory
	Quick Build : Skips menu, so you will not have any menu interface, just a straight build and done
	Multiply cores count : This'll multiply the number of cores for building by 2 (if you have 2 cores, you'll use 4 threads for building)
- Depending on your choice, you'll either enter Quick Build (where your kernel are built), or sent to the menu
